# week2_course5_assignment1
this is a redo of my submission from last time ,hence the commits are latest yet you might find some dates which are old .
Reason for redo - 
i had uploaded the rmd and html files on the repository however these file types do not render output , it is necessary to 
change the file type to rmarkdown::github_document. 
In order to access my code+ output ,access project1.md  , the raw source is in project1.rmd and graphs have been uploaded separately
